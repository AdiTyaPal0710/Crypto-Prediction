# Crypto Historical Data Analysis and Prediction

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline for retrieving, processing, and predicting cryptocurrency metrics based on historical data. The task focuses on working with APIs, handling large data, calculating trading metrics, and making predictions using machine learning models.

## Overview
This project retrieves historical trading data for frequently traded cryptocurrency pairs from the CoinGecko API. It then calculates several analytical metrics, such as historical highs and lows, and uses a machine learning model to predict future percentage differences based on recent historical data.

## Project Structure
- `crypto_calc.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data retrieval and metric calculations.
- `ml_model.py`: Python script for training and evaluating machine learning models.
- `crypto.xlsx`: Excel file containing historical data and calculated metrics.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

## Features
### Data Retrieval
- Fetches historical data for specified cryptocurrency pairs from the CoinGecko API.
- Data includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, aggregated daily.

### Metric Calculation
- Calculates historical high/low and future high/low prices over specific periods.
- Adds percentage differences from historical and future highs/lows.

### Machine Learning Predictions
- Uses `RandomForestRegressor` and `XGBRegressor` to predict:
  - % Difference from High Next 5 Days
  - % Difference from Low Next 5 Days
- Compares models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and selects the best-performing model for predictions.

## API Research
We used the CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency data. The API provides free access to daily historical data on top-traded crypto pairs.

- **Supported Pairs:** Covers a range of popular cryptocurrency pairs.
- **Timeframes:** Daily data; hourly data not available in this configuration.
- **Data Range:** Available from CoinGeckoâ€™s historical data start date to present day.

## Data Retrieval and Processing
The `fetch_crypto_data` function retrieves daily price data starting from a specified date. The data is then processed and saved in `crypto.xlsx` with key calculated metrics for easy access and visualization.

## Machine Learning Models
### Feature Columns:
- Days Since High Last 7 Days
- % Diff From High Last 7 Days
- Days Since Low Last 7 Days
- % Diff From Low Last 7 Days

### Target Columns:
- % Diff From High Next 5 Days
- % Diff From Low Next 5 Days

### Models Used:
- **`RandomForestRegressor`:** Used for general accuracy in structured data.
- **`XGBRegressor`:** For optimized tree-based regression with custom learning rates.

### Training and Evaluation:
Both models are trained, and the best-performing one (lowest MSE) is saved as `best_crypto_model.pkl`.

## Results
Models are evaluated on Mean Squared Error (MSE), and predictions for new data points can be generated using the `predict_outcomes` function. Metrics are saved in `crypto.xlsx`, which can be visualized in Excel or further analyzed.

## Challenges
- **API Rate Limits:** Ensured data retrieval compliance within free API limitations.
- **Data Completeness:** Handled missing data cases with `dropna` functions.
- **Model Selection:** Balanced accuracy with model efficiency using two regressors.

## Next Steps
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Expand functionality to handle multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously.
- Integrate additional indicators or metrics for deeper analysis.
