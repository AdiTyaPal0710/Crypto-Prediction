## Overview
This project retrieves historical trading data for frequently traded cryptocurrency pairs from the CoinGecko API. It then calculates several analytical metrics, such as historical highs and lows, and uses a machine learning model to predict future percentage differences based on recent historical data.

## Project Structure
- `crypto_calc.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data retrieval and metric calculations.
- `ml_model.py`: Python script for training and evaluating machine learning models.
- `crypto.xlsx`: Excel file containing historical data and calculated metrics.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the project.
